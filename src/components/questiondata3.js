    HidenText:
      "Data structures & algorithms (DS/A) is a key topic in software engineering because it guides us on how to solve large-scale computational problems efficiently (with special data structures & specific algorithms). It teaches us how to think about writing efficient solutions. DS/A is the complement to System Design. DS/A is how we efficiently solve problems with procedure (code) on-machine (or across systems), & system design shows us how to orchestrate machines efficiently to solve problems.",
